# October

A small Service abstraction library that lives on top of Serde and the Iron web framework.
October is inspired by the core concept of Finagle, that of representing a service very simply, as `S: Req -> Res`.
Unlike Finagle, October is a very tiny abstraction with the goal of building strongly typed Iron handlers.

##### Name

October is a reference to October Song by Seabound.
